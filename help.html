    const topicText = {
      download: `Installing FraudGuard is as quick as it is secure, but every
      browser environment is a little different, so this guide walks you through
      the complete process step by step. Begin by opening the Chrome Web Store
      and typing “FraudGuard” into the search bar. Confirm that the publisher
      name reads “FraudGuard Security Labs” so you know you’re downloading the
      official build. Click the blue “Add to Chrome” button, review the minimal
      permissions we request—limited to reading URLs so we can check them
      against our fraud database—and then approve the install. Chrome downloads
      the signed CRX package, validates its signature to ensure it hasn’t been
      tampered with, and automatically enables it. The shield icon appears next
      to your address bar; you can pin it by clicking the puzzle‑piece icon for
      instant access. If you’re on a managed network that disables the Web
      Store, fetch the offline installer from our enterprise page along with a
      JSON policy file to roll the extension out to multiple endpoints.`,
      
      billing: `FraudGuard follows a people‑first subscription model, meaning a
      single license covers every desktop browser profile you sign into. We use
      Stripe for billing to guarantee PCI‑DSS Level 1 compliance and offer a
      wide range of regional payment methods, from international credit cards to
      UPI and Paytm in India. In your Account Portal you can download tax‑ready
      invoices, change billing frequency, or swap payment methods without
      contacting support. Cancelation is self‑service and immediate: protection
      remains active until the end of your term, after which your account
      downgrades gracefully to the free tier with no loss of data or settings.
      We offer prorated refunds within the first thirty days because security
      products must earn your trust. Students, educators, and recognised
      non‑profits qualify for permanent discounts—open a ticket with valid proof
      and our team will adjust your plan accordingly.`,
      
      scams: `Fraud evolves daily, yet the psychological triggers attackers rely
      on remain unchanged: urgency, curiosity, and fear. FraudGuard’s threat
      engine harvests feeds from phishing takedown networks, brand‑abuse
      trackers, and our own machine‑learning classifier that inspects DOM
      fingerprints in real time. When you land on a suspicious site, a bold red
      banner appears with clear language explaining the danger. You can still
      proceed if you’re absolutely certain, but we log the event anonymously so
      our analysts can review false positives. Remember common red flags:
      misspelled domains, awkward grammar, and requests for cryptocurrency
      payments are giant warning signs. If you encounter a new scam, hit the
      “Flag Scam” option in the banner—this packages a hash of the page, never
      your personal data, and forwards it to our analysts. Our average takedown
      partnership removes malicious sites within twelve hours of first report.`,
      
      signin: `Signing in unlocks FraudGuard Premium: live phishing lookups,
      breach‑monitor alerts, and cloud‑sync preferences. We use OAuth 2.0 with
      short‑lived access tokens so your credentials never reside inside the
      extension. After clicking any “Sign In” button you’ll be redirected to
      accounts.fraudguard.app, where we recommend enabling a second factor such
      as TOTP or FIDO U2F security keys. Once authenticated you’re returned to
      the Help Center, the toolbar icon turns red, and premium features activate
      seamlessly in the background. Forgot your password? The reset link
      expires after sixty minutes for extra safety. Social log‑ins via Google,
      GitHub, and Apple ID are fully supported so you can use whichever identity
      provider you trust most.`,
      
      support: `Our support desk is operated by real cybersecurity engineers, not
      outsourced call centres reading from scripts. Email
      support@fraudguard.app, start a live chat on our homepage, or join our
      public Discord where the core dev team answers questions between code
      sprints. Include the full URL of any suspicious site, browser version, and
      steps to reproduce the problem—this cuts diagnosis time in half. Premium
      users receive responses within two hours, but we aim to reply faster.
      Telephone callbacks can be scheduled from the portal; we will never phone
      you unexpectedly because scammers spoof security companies. All tickets
      are stored encrypted at rest, and we regularly publish anonymised case
      studies so the community benefits from lessons learned.`,
      
      about: `FraudGuard began as a weekend experiment by two friends who kept
      removing malware from family laptops. We realised that traditional
      antivirus software focused on viruses, not the modern plague of fake
      stores, phishing portals, and tech‑support scams draining people’s
      savings. Today our team includes threat researchers, former law‑
      enforcement analysts, and ethical hackers united by a mission: make
      trustworthy browsing free and frictionless. We operate on three core
      principles—transparency, respectful data handling, and community‑driven
      innovation. All critical components are open to independent audit, every
      feature request is discussed publicly in GitHub issues, and a portion of
      revenue is reinvested into takedown campaigns that remove fraudulent sites
      at the hosting level. FraudGuard is more than a browser extension; it is a
      pledge that ordinary users deserve the same calibre of protection Fortune
      500 companies enjoy.`,
      
      privacy: `We designed FraudGuard to be privacy‑first from day one because
      security without privacy is a half‑measure. The extension never logs full
      URLs, page content, keystrokes, or cookies. To perform cloud reputation
      checks we hash the hostname and send only that anonymised fingerprint over
      an encrypted channel, discarding the request after the verdict is
      returned. Crash reports and telemetry are strictly opt‑in and, when
      enabled, are scrubbed of any personally identifying information before
      leaving your device. Our infrastructure is hosted in ISO 27001‑certified
      data centres located in privacy‑friendly jurisdictions and is subjected to
      quarterly penetration tests. We are fully GDPR‑compliant and support data
      deletion requests that are processed within seventy‑two hours. Your data
      stays yours—always.`,
      
      contact: `Need to reach us? We offer multiple secure channels so you can
      choose whichever suits you best. For routine questions, email
      support@fraudguard.app; average response time is under two hours on
      business days. Complex technical cases can be opened directly on our
      GitHub tracker where engineers collaborate openly. Real‑time assistance is
      available via live chat on fraudguard.app or our community Discord, which
      also hosts weekly “Ask‑Me‑Anything” sessions with the development team.
      Media, partnership, or legal inquiries should be directed to
      press@fraudguard.app. We never outsource support, so the people replying
      are the same folks building the product. Include browser version, OS, and
      any relevant screenshots for fastest resolution. We genuinely value your
      input—every feature on our roadmap began as a user suggestion!`
